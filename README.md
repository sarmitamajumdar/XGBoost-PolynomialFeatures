# XGBoost with Polynomial Features  
*Boosting accuracy through non-linear feature engineering with Python*  

---

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how **polynomial features** can enhance the predictive power of **XGBoost**.  

We use the **Titanic dataset** to:  
- Train a **baseline XGBoost model**  
- Expand the feature space using **polynomial transformations**  
- Compare performance improvements  
- Visualize feature importance  

**Result**: Polynomial features capture non-linear interactions and significantly improve accuracy.
